# Socket.io-chat

This is a chat using Socket.io, node.js and express.
It has a functionality that includes a command caled with the "/" and calls 2 external APIs.

Here is the description of the assignment + its requirements:

###

In this submission, you will create a chat-based app that allows users to chat with each other in real time.
The communication must be set up and done with socket.io.
In addition to the chat part of the task, it must also be possible to write commands.
This is done by starting to type "/" and then gives the user suggestions for valid commands - similar to how it works in, for example, Slack.

The API call to the external service must take place via your own API (express server). You choose yourself if you want to use an extended development stack in the project, note that this is not a requirement.

Examples of frameworks you can add to your stack are: typescript, react, etc. Let the creativity flow!
To pass this assignment, you MUST use GIT and GitHub. The submission takes place as usual via It ́s Learning, where submit your project folder as a zip file.
In the project folder there must be (in addition to all the code) a README.md file that contains a title, description of the task, list of which requirements are met, what is required to build and start the project and a link to the GitHub repot.

Note that if instructions for how to build and start the project are not available or if the instructions are incorrect, the task will be failed.
In addition to the code, an oral presentation must be carried out per group where you have a demo of the program you have created.
1 Pair up in groups of 2 or 3 - you choose yourself who you work with.

Carefully read through the entire task description together before you begin.
